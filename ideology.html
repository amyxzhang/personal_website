		      				<h3>Abstract</h3>
		      				
		      				Social media has emerged as a prominent platform where
people can express their feelings about social and political
issues of our time. We study the many voices discussing an
issue within a constituency and how they reflect ideology and
may signal the outcome of important policy decisions. Focusing
on the issue of same-sex marriage legalization, we examine
almost 2 million public Twitter posts related to same-sex
marriage in the U.S. states over the course of 4 years starting
from 2011. Among other findings, we find evidence of moral
culture wars between ideologies and show that constituencies
that express higher levels of emotion and have fewer actively
engaged participants often precede legalization efforts that
fail. From our measures, we build statistical models to predict
the outcome of potential policy changes, with our best
model achieving 87% accuracy. We also achieve accuracies
of 70%, comparable to public opinion surveys, many months
before a policy decision. We discuss how these analyses can
augment traditional political science techniques as well as assist
activists and policy analysts in understanding discussions
on important issues at a population scale.

			We gathered our social media data from Twitter, specifically the Twitter Firehose, a dataset of all public posts made on Twitter.
			We used a set of 73 keywords and phrases such as "same-sex marriage", "traditional marriage", and others to determine what tweets were
			related to same-sex marriage and gay rights. The tweets were captured from 2011 to July 2014 - 3 and a half years when quite a lot of states
			considered same-sex marriage legislation. And we also geographically tagged the tweets to a specific state using the user's profile location field,
			discarding the ones where we were unable to determine the location. The details of how we did this are in the paper.

For most of our measures, we used techniques such as LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), which are dictionaries created by domain experts
and linguists that match certain categories.

	To capture ideology, we collected both morality and personality measures. We used political psychology research that demonstrates that the personality that
	people have and the underlying moral ideals that people hold dear say a lot about their political orientation and stance on a whole host of issues.
	So for instance, am I the kind of person who cares more about maintaining fairness? Or about respecting authority?

	To help further characterize the discussions within constituencies, we also collect the measure emotionality, including basic positive and negative sentiment,
	as well as anxiety, anger, and swear words. We also collect levels of certainty, so the use of certain versus tentative language. And we collect activity level,
	which looks more at volume and number of users tweeting instead of language use.

	First as one example of validation of our methods, you can see how our religion measure correlates when matched up against more
	traditional methods - in this case Gallup polling that asks people how religious they are.
	<BR><BR>
		You can see that both methods have darker areas in the Bible belt, or southern states in the U.S., while the north and coasts are less religious.
		<BR><BR>
			You can also see a bit more variance in the less populated regions, highlighting how in many places Twitter is just not used that often, leading to

We can also characterize how states fall along the spectrum of liberal versus conservative on the issue of same-sex marriage.
Here we compared how far away states were from each other when comparing their ideological measures. The darker the color, the more
two states match. Once we clustered the distances, we can see how conservative states cluster on one end. All the states that considered
legalizing same-sex marriage in the conservative cluster had bills that failed or are pending.
<BR><BR>
	More liberal states clustered on the other side. 12/14 states in the liberal cluster have legalized same-sex marriage as of July 2014. And in the middle we have what
	we call "battleground" states, where it's not immediately certain what side they're on. This group accounts from 71% of the policy events
	that happened in our time span.
	<BR><BR>
		The issue I mentioned previously about more rural states comes up again here - you can see that Wyoming is a clear outlier from everyone else due in part to its
		small and mostly rural population. So that's one of the
		limitations of our method.

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
		Taking that analysis a step further, we can analyze how states move over time with respect to the different clusters of liberal, conservative, and battleground.
		In this analysis, we looked at clusters generated from data in 2011 and clusters from the year 2013. We visualize the states that moved clusters from one year
		to the other. Since the original clusters are in high dimension, we used Principle Component Analysis to get that down to two dimensions - but that means that you should
		focus on the relative distances between points as opposed to what the axes represent.<BR><BR>
			We can see Texas and North Carolina moved more to the conservatie side during this time period. In fact North Carolina was the only state to approve legislation banning
			same-sex marriage during this time. And all three states moving to the liberal side have legalized gay marriage during or before this time period.

		When we wook at the week directly preceding the policy decision, and we separate the events that eventually passed versus the ones that
		eventually failed, we can see some big differences between some of the measures. The percentages here are with respect to the national
		average during that week.<BR><BR>
			For instance, we see that the openness personality and fairness moral value are much higher for policies that pass versus policies that
			fail, and the moral concern for harm is higher for policies that fail.

								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
We also see overall higher levels of engagement for policies that pass. For policies that fail, we see much higher levels of tentativeness.

							</div>
							<BR>
					<div class="row">
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
									<img class="alignleft3" align="left" alt="mailing lists" src="img/ideologyCHI/ideologyCHI.025.jpg" />

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
And for the measure of emotion, we see higher levels of anxiety before policies that fail.

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
		We can also look further back for a policy change event. Here we look at the six months prior to a policy decision, plotting the 
		value of the measure over time, again comparing passing versus failing policies within a single graph. Here are a few for comparison.
		So here you can see how some measures are greater than others over the entire course of the time, for instance with religiousness and purity
		representing more conservative values and openness and fairness representing more liberal values.
		<BR><BR>
			But it was also interesting to see how these measures are changing over time. For instance, notice how with tentativeness, policies that
			pass have decreasing tentativeness over time while policies that fail have increasing tentativeness. And likewise, the moral value of ingroup also
			crosses during the 6 months leading up to the final decision.

					We can also get an idea of the different features that ended up being useful for classification purposes. On the left we have
					the slope measure over 2 months before and on the right we have the average alue in the 1 week before. And you can see that
					the most important features are pretty different for the two types of features.

								We can also get an idea of how our different measure categories did overall. Here we look at the r^2 metric,
								which is a measure of goodness-of-fit using a logistic regression. For comparison purposes, I split up
								Emotionality into Sentiment and Emotion, with emotion containing just anger, anxiety, and swear words.
								We can see that overall Sentiment by itself was really not a good indicator for passing or failing legislation, while
								the Moral Values that we extracted were really helpful for our task. So if we had just done sentiment analysis,
								we probably wouldn't have done a great job.

									But can we do better? Well right now, we're just using the measures within a state to predict the outcome for that state.
									For instance, if a bill is coming up in Texas, we're looking at what people are saying on Twitter within Texas leading up to the vote.
									
									<BR><BR>
										But a lot of the news and discussion surrounding gay marriage during this time spilled over into other states. For instance,
										I definitely heard about Prop 8 in California and the bill in New York even though I was in Massachusetts at the time.
										<BR><BR>
											
											But then if we do include other states, how should we weigh their measures? There's political science research that demonstrates
											 that states are influenced by other states with similar ideologies. So if I'm in Massachusetts, I might be interested in what's going on in
											 California. There's additional political science research that shows that states are influenced by neighboring states. So Texas might be
											 interested in what's going on in New Mexico.
											 <BR><BR>
											 	When we tested both ways of weighing other states, we found that weighing by geography actually performed the best.

		several months from now, how will I do?

So here we made a prediction every single day over the course of a year before each policy decision and we show the average prediction accuracy
over time. So it turns out that we can get a pretty decent prediction, around 70%, even going back several months in advance of the policy decision.

	So now for some future work in this area along with some interesting applications. First it would be interesting to see how our analysis
	generalizes to other issues such as marijuana legalization. The measures we used, particularly the ideological measures, might themselves
	be useful for things like recommending content or promoting empathy. And finally, the entire pipeline I just outlined for you all, you could imagine
	that used in a real-time dashboard that would be extremely useful for policy analysts, activists, and political organizations.
