		      				While the web contains many social websites, people are
generally left in the dark about the activities of other people
traversing the web as a whole. In this paper, we explore
the potential benefits and privacy considerations around generating
a real-time, publicly accessible stream of web activity
where users can publish chosen parts of their web browsing
data. Taking inspiration from social media systems, we describe
individual benefits that can be unlocked by such sharing
and that may incentivize users to publish aspects of their
browsing. We ask whether and how these benefits outweigh
potential costs in lost privacy. We conduct our study of public
web activity sharing through scenario-based interviews and a
field deployment of a tool for web activity sharing.

									So first, I'm going to talk a bit about the status quo and what is really the motivation for this study and the tool we eventually built.

Then I'm going to go into some considerations about the design space and privacy based on interviews we conducted before discussing a tool that we built and then studied in a field study.

								Today, web tracking is a huge industry, where tons of effort and money is going into tracking the browsing activity of people online.

								We researchers don't really have access to this data because it can be so sensitive and personal. For instance, the infamous AOL query log dataset from the 90s was an anonymized dataset for researchers but actually leaked personal information.

However, there are a lot of companies that do have access to this data, including big ones like Google and Facebook but little ones you may not have heard of like Quantcast, Undertone, Traffic Marketplace.

Some of these are large ad networks that get your browsing data from banner ads or little javascript snippets or cookies.

Even software you download for purposes such as security can and do take your browsing information.

These companies can also turn around and sell your data to others.

								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
						So the current status quo around browser tracking is totally broken. Researchers can't access data for the public good, people who create the data can't use it for their own benefit, companies have all the data and all the power when making products. 

People think they are having a private, personal experience but are actually sharing that experience with God knows who, who can turn around and sell it or accidentally leak it to the public. So what can we do about this?

								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
									
									Without laws in place, we can't fix all of these problems. But we can maybe demonstrate what a potential future without indiscriminate browser tracking might look like.

A future where browsing data can be used to benefit the people that create the data as well as the public good, and not just corporations.



And to do this, one place where we got inspiration is from social media.


In social media, traditional surveillance is turned on its head to become peer or social surveillance.

That is people choose what to share and who to share it with, sometimes choosing the public.

There's also an ecosystem in place to cater to users' needs to encourage them to share on their platform.


Finally, when the data is publicly available, it's led to new and interesting research and active development.

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
						
						So what social and personal benefits could we potentially derive from sharing something like browsing data with each other?

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
								Here's where I'm going to get into some of the benefits that we might derive from sharing aspects of our browsing data. And some of these things already exist in small pockets of the web or in apps and I'll give examples.

				One thing that some applications and websites allow is real-time presence of other people on that application or website.
				One example is places like Facebook or Google Hangouts that let you know who is online at that moment.
				Other places include Google Docs, where you can see who else is on that doc at the moment (and can also be anonymous). Finally, in real-life,
				applications like Foursquare let you see who else is currently in a place with you.

									Another feature is chatting and commenting anchored to a particular page or place. Many news places on the web
									allow you to add comments at the bottom of an article. There are also some pages that have anchored real-time chat.

				Another feature is ambient awareness of others. This can be in the form of a feed, for instance, the feed in Facebook that shows
				more real-time activity. It can also be in the form of a bar like in Spotify, where you can see what people are currently listening to.

		Reflection and self improvement are potential personal benefits of sharing browsing activity. 
		The application RescueTime currently privately collects one's browsing activity in order to 
		show to the user how much time they've spent on different sites. This information can help
		users manage their time or try to change their online browsing habits.
		
		In addition, some applications for self-improvement have a social element that
		allows them to share their activity with friends. These include many fitness or diet applications

		To do this, we interviewed three sets of friend/acquaintance groups. Later we use these
		groups in our field study of our application, which is why we specifically sought out groups of
		people that knew each other.
		
		We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews from 30 minutes to 80 minutes.
		We presented the interviewees with scenarios and showed them screenshots of existing applications like
		the ones mentioned earlier while discussing sharing browsing activity.

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">

For the participants, we interviewed one set of close friends, one set of journalist acquaintances,
and one set of more technical people. 

We were interested in hearing from journalists because (taking cues from sites like Twitter) we thought
they might have a particular interest in such a tool and they are more used to navigating a more public space online.

We were also interested in more technical people who would have a better understanding of privacy and who conduct much of their 
work online.

When it came to self-presentation, this feature was more of a draw for the News interviewees,

in presenting a specific self to their friends.

		Along with self-presentation is transparency, which was very salient to both News and Tech.

Likewise Tech people saw parallels between this and places like Github for when they were conducting work online.

These were the different fears that interviewees expressed when it came to sharing aspects of their
browsing data.

In the end, we should design a system that is explicit and 
respects users' expectations. 
There should be no surprises for the user.

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
So our interviewees said, echoing previous work, that they want to have a say over whether or not they are tracked.

Ownership means the power to share what browsing data they want and also the power to take it away or give it to someone else.

Unfortunately, many corporations currently operate with little awareness, and users have little recourse or say over their tracking.

All interviewees agreed that different websites and topics on the web had different levels of privacy to them.

Some examples of areas where they preferred greater secrecy included medical sites, dating, shopping, politics, and banking.

Unfortunately most tracking today is comprehensive and not context-dependent.

We'll talk about how we use this information later.

Most interviewees expected that if they released their browsing data, it was because they were getting something useful or valuable in return.

However, companies exist that simply track or buy tracking data, or do so surreptitiously.

Sometimes they disliked some of the things they got in return, such as personalized ads or recommendations. 

Users also little recourse to affect the results of tracking.

So anything we build in the end needs to demonstrate usefulness or interestingness to the user.

		Because of our finding earlier that people expect differing levels of privacy on different websites, we used a domain-level whitelisting behavior.			
					
		By default, nothing is shared on Eyebrowse.
					
		While browsing the web, the extension shows a popup on the corner right every now and then asking if you would like
		to whitelist this domain.
		
		If you click yes, the domain is added to your whitelist and visits within that domain are shared.

Whitelisting of domains was overall a success.

However, there were cases however of people wanting more fine-grained access.

For instance, they wanted to track their overall  time spent on Facebook but didn't want to
show individual pages. 
In the future we should develop the ability to have more fine-grained but also optional privacy controls.

	When it came to the features, the field study demonstrated many ways forward.
	In its raw form, the browsing data is very noisy. More sophisticated methods for

	Before we close - back to why we made Eyebrowse public. 
	As this interviewee expressed, one benefit of making this data publicly available

	developers build on the data to make new insights and build new applications 
	to benefit users.
