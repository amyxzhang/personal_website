										Digital Juries: A Civics-Oriented Approach to Platform
Governance </span></h4>


 Drawing
inspiration from constitutional jury trials in many legal systems, this paper proposes 
digital juries as a civics-oriented
approach for adjudicating content moderation cases. Building
on existing theoretical models of jury decision-making, we
outline a 5-stage model characterizing the space of design
considerations in a digital jury process. We implement two
examples of jury designs involving blind-voting and deliberation.
 From users who participate in our jury implementations,
we gather informed judgments of the democratic legitimacy
of a jury process for content moderation. We find that digital
juries are perceived as more procedurally just than existing
common platform moderation practices, but also find 
disagreement over whether jury decisions should be enforced or used
as recommendations.

										How do Data Science Workers Collaborate? Roles, Workflows, and Tools </span></h4>



 In this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants 
 who work in various aspects of data science. We focused on their 
 reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers)
  and with different tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). We found that 
  data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a 
  variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps 
  of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). 
  We also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, 
  such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools 
  they use. Based on these findings, we discuss design 
  implications for supporting data science team collaborations 
  and future research directions.

										Ph.D. Thesis: Systems for Collective Human Curation of Online
Discussion</span></h4>


The internet was supposed to democratize discussion, allowing people from all walks
of life to communicate with each other at scale. However, this vision has not been fully
realized—instead online discourse seems to be getting worse, as people are increasingly
drowning in discussion, with much of it unwanted or unpleasant. In this thesis, I
present new systems that empower discussion participants to work collectively to
bring order to discussions through a range of curation tools that superimpose richer
metadata structure on top of standard discussion formats. These systems enable
the following new capabilities: 1) recursive summarization of threaded forums using
Wikum, 2) teamsourced tagging and summarization of group chat using Tilda, 3)
fine-grained customization of email delivery within mailing lists using Murmur, and
4) friendsourced moderation of messages against online harassment using Squadbox.
<BR><BR>
In a world of abundant discussion and mass capabilities for amplification, the
curation of a social space becomes as equally essential as content creation in defining
the nature of that space. By putting more powerful techniques for curation in the
hands of everyday people, I envision a future where end users are empowered to
actively co-create every aspect of their online discussion environments, bringing in
their nuanced and contextual insights.

										Opportunities for Automating Email Processing: A Need-Finding Study </span></h4>


Email management consumes significant effort from senders
and recipients. Some of this work might be automatable. We
performed a mixed-methods need-finding study to learn: (i)
what sort of automatic email handling users want, and (ii)
what kinds of information and computation are needed to
support that automation. To further investigate our findings, we developed a
platform for authoring small scripts over a user's inbox. Of
the automations found in our studies, half are impossible in
popular email clients, motivating new design directions.

Group chat systems generate long streams of unstructured back-and-forth discussion 
that are difficult to comprehend. 
We investigate ways to enrich the representation of chat conversations, 
using techniques such as tagging and summarization, to enable users to better make 
sense of chat. Through needfinding interviews with 15 active group chat users,  we found the importance of 
structured representations, including signals such as discourse acts. 
We then developed Tilda, a prototype system that enables people to 
collaboratively enrich their chat conversation while conversing.

										Squadbox: A Tool to Combat Email Harassment Using Friendsourced Moderation</a></span></h4>

Communication platforms have struggled to provide effective tools for people facing harassment online. 
We conducted interviews with 18 recipients of online harassment to understand their strategies for coping, 
finding that they often resorted to asking friends for help.
Inspired by these findings, we explore the feasibility of <i>friendsourced moderation</i> as a technique 
for combating online harassment. We present Squadbox, a tool to help recipients of email harassment coordinate a 
"squad" of friend moderators to shield and support them during attacks.

		Given the variety of approaches to combat misinformation, collective agreement on the indicators that signify credible content 
		could allow for greater collaboration and data-sharing across initiatives. 
		We present an initial 
		set of indicators for article credibility defined by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate 
		from both within an article's text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, 
		we present a dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our indicators by 6 trained annotators 
		using specialized platforms.

We investigate using crowd-based human evaluation to inspect, evaluate, and improve clusters to create 
high-quality clustered search results at scale. We introduce a workflow that begins by using a 
collection of well-known clustering algorithms to produce a set of clustered search results for a given query. 
Then, we use crowd workers to holistically assess the quality of each clustered search result in order to 
find the best one. Finally, the workflow has the crowd spot and fix problems in the best result in
 order to produce a final output. We evaluate this workflow on 120 top 
 search queries from the Google Play Store.<br>

										Deliberation and Resolution on Wikipedia: A Case Study of
Requests for Comments</span></h4>
We present an analysis
of Requests for Comments (RfCs), one of the main vehicles on Wikipedia for formally resolving a policy or
content dispute. We collected an exhaustive dataset of 7,316 RfCs on English Wikipedia over the course of
7 years and conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis into what issues affect the RfC process. We found that a major issue affecting the
RfC process is the prevalence of RfCs that could have benefited from formal closure but that linger indefinitely
without one.
From these findings, we developed a model that predicts whether an RfC will go stale with 75.3% accuracy, a
level that is approached as early as one week after dispute initiation.

										Post-literate Programming: Linking Discussion and Code in Software Development Teams.</span></h4>
		
		The literate programming paradigm presents a program interleaved with natural language 
		text explaining the code's
rationale and logic. While this is great for program readers,
the labor of creating literate programs deters most program authors from providing this text at authoring time. 
Instead, as we
determine through interviews, developers provide their design
rationales after the fact, in discussions with collaborators. We
propose to capture these discussions and incorporate them into
the code. We have prototyped a tool to link online discussion
of code directly to the code it discusses. Incorporating these
discussions incrementally creates post-literate programs that
convey information to future developers.

We present a novel method for classifying comments in online discussions into a set of coarse discourse acts 
towards the goal of better understanding discussions at scale.
We collect and release a corpus of over 9,000 threads comprising over 100,000 comments manually annotated via paid 
crowdsourcing with discourse acts and randomly sampled from the site Reddit. Using our corpus, we demonstrate how 
the analysis of discourse acts can characterize different types of discussions, including discourse sequences 
such as Q&A pairs and chains of disagreement, as well as different communities. Finally, we conduct experiments 
to predict discourse acts using our corpus, finding that structured prediction models such as conditional random 
fields can achieve an F1 score of 75%.

Large-scale discussions between many participants abound on the internet today, on topics ranging from political arguments to 
group coordination. But as these discussions grow to tens of thousands of posts, they become ever more difficult for a reader to digest.
In this article, we describe a workflow called <i>recursive summarization</i>, implemented in our <i>Wikum</i> prototype, that enables 
a large population of readers or editors to work in small doses to refine out the main points of the discussion.  More than just a 
single summary, our workflow produces a <i>summary tree</i> that enables a reader to explore distinct subtopics at multiple levels 
of detail based on their interests.

										Using Student Annotated Hashtags and Emojis to Collect Nuanced Affective States</span></h4>

Determining affective states such as confusion from students' participation in online discussion forums can be useful for instructors 
of a large classroom. In this work, we harness affordances prevalent in social media to allow students to self-annotate their 
discussion posts with a set of hashtags and emojis, a process that is fast and cheap.
From a dataset of over 25,000 discussion posts from two courses containing self-annotated posts by students, we demonstrate 
how we can identify linguistic differences between posts expressing confusion versus curiosity, achieving 83% accuracy 
at distinguishing between the two affective states.

										Mavo: Creating Interactive Data-Driven Web Applications by Authoring HTML</a></span></h4>

Many people can author static web pages with HTML and CSS but find it hard or impossible to program persistent, 
interactive web applications. We show that for a broad class of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications, 
this gap can be bridged. Mavo extends the declarative syntax of HTML to describe Web applications that manage, 
store and transform data. Using Mavo, authors with basic HTML knowledge define complex data schemas implicitly as 
they design their HTML layout. They need only add a few attributes and expressions to their HTML elements to 
transform their static design into a persistent, data-driven web application whose data can be edited by 
direct manipulation of the content in the browser.

									</a>
										</span></h4>

In the past few years an unprecedented wave of anti-abortion policies were introduced and enacted in state governments 
in the U.S., affecting millions of constituents. We study this rapid spread of policy change as a function of 
the underlying ideology of constituents. We examine over 200,000 public messages posted on Twitter surrounding abortion 
in the year 2013, a year that saw 82 new anti-abortion policies enacted. From these posts, we characterize people's expressions 
of opinion on abortion and show how these expressions align with policy change on these issues.

									We piloted a meetup session at CSCW '15 called "Confer Coffee", creating groups from people who liked similar papers on Confer, who then gathered in person at the conference,

Mailing lists have existed since the early days of email and

forums and social media websites proliferate. 
We explore why members prefer mailing
lists to other group communication tools. But we also
identify several tensions around mailing list usage that appear
to contribute to dissatisfaction with them.
