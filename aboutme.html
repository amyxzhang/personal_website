undergraduates.
</P>

<B>2019</B>: I went on the job market and accepted a position at UW CSE, deferring for one year. 
I also defended my thesis on systems for collective human curation, graduated, and started a 1-year postdoc at Stanford.
</P>

<P>
<B>2018</B>:
I started a fellowship at the Harvard Berkman Klein Center for 2018-19, thinking and writing about online
content moderation, particularly in the context of online harassment and misinformation. I also got married!
</P>

<P>
<B>2017</B>:
I spent my summer at Microsoft Research in Redmond, MA and worked with 
Justin Cranshaw on building a Slack chat app to annotate and summarize chat conversations for people who need to catch up.
I worked with an MEng student, Kaitlin Mahar, on a tool to help people facing harassment get help from friends.
And I started as a founding member of the Credibility Coalition, an international organization for standards around
news credibility and information quality online.
</P>

<P>
<B>2016</B>:
I spent my summer at Google Research in San Francisco, CA and worked with 
Bryan Culbertson and Praveen Paritosh on classifying back-and-forth posts within forums like Reddit with their discourse act towards improving applications such as search.
I also built out and conducted user studies for Wikum, a tool for summarizing long discussion threads.
</P>

<P>
<B>2015</B>:
I spent my summer at Google Research in Mountain View, CA and worked with 
Jilin Chen and Ed Chi on using crowdsourcing to evaluate and refine search clusters for a mobile app store.
I continued the work I started in the previous summer with Scott Counts, now looking at anti-abortion policy.
And I built and conducted a user study on Eyebrowse, a tool for social web browsing, along with MIT student Josh Blum.
</P>


<P>
<B>2014</B>:
I started my PhD program in January! My first project was on mailing lists, and 
I began with interviews and surveys of mailing list users.
I spent my summer at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA and worked with 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/counts/">Scott Counts</a> on modeling and
predicting policy change using Twitter. 
</P>

<P>
<B>2013</B>:
I worked as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.newscred.com">NewsCred</a>, a

<h3><span class="mini-header">Tennis</span></h3>

<img class="aboutpic2" align="right" src="http://amyxzhang.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/7922_169078010008_503955008_3199920_7586825_n.jpg" width="240" height="360" />
<P>
	
Besides being a student and researcher, I was formerly a competitive tennis player in college, having played tennis since the age of 5.
</P>
<P> 
In my Ph.D., I was a volunteer assistant tennis coach for the DIII <a href="http://mitathletics.com/sports/w-tennis/coaches/Zhang_Amy">MIT Women's Tennis Team</a>.
</P>
<P>
In my Masters, I played for 
the<a href="https://cultc.soc.srcf.net/"> Cambridge University Women's Blues 
	Varsity Squad</a>, 
	 competed in the BUCS (British Universities and Colleges Sport) Championship, 
	 played at Wimbledon in a fixture against the All England Club, 
	 and earned a Blue for defeating Oxford University in the annual varsity match.
</P>
<P>
In my undergraduate years, I was a Division-I athlete, participating in the 
<a href="http://scarletknights.com/tennis-women/">Rutgers Women's Tennis Team</a> as 
part of the Big East Conference. Over four years, I was voted Captain and MVP, 
compiled a 67-18 singles record and 62-24 doubles record, mostly all at 1st position. 
Highlights include being named an Academic All-American (third team), winning the 2011 National 
Arthur Ashe Award for Scholarship and Leadership, maintaining an undefeated singles 
record in home matches at Rutgers, and becoming nationally ranked in the U.S. for doubles.

<h3><span class="mini-header">Photography and Travel</span></h3>

One of my hobbies is film photography. Nowadays I shoot with a Nikon F100 film camera as well as a D7100 DSLR on occasion.
Previously I shot with a Nikon FM-10 as well as a Canon XSi.
I also enjoy traveling and take many photos when I travel. See below for some photos (though this is really out of date now unfortunately)!
