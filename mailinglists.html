		      				<h3>Abstract</h3>
		      				
		      				Mailing lists have existed since the early days of email and are still widely used today, 
		      				even as more sophisticated online forums and social media websites proliferate. 
		      				The simplicity of mailing lists can be seen as a reason for their endurance, 
		      				a source of dissatisfaction, and an opportunity for improvement. Using a mixed-method approach, 
		      				we studied two community mailing lists in depth with interviews and surveys, and 
		      				surveyed a broader spectrum of 28 lists. We report how members of the different communities 
		      				use their lists and their goals and desires for them. We explore why members prefer mailing 
		      				lists to other group communication tools. But we also identify several tensions around mailing 
		      				list usage that appear to contribute to dissatisfaction with them. We conclude with design 
		      				implications, discussing ways to alleviate these tensions while preserving mailing lists' appeal.

									Believe it or not, mailing lists are 40 years old! The first mailing list was created in 1971. To give you
									a sense of how long ago that was, that was back when people dressed like tihs and thought it was cool. In terms
									of technology years, much like dog years, 40 years seems like an even longer time. After all, this is what a 
									personal computer and a typical phone looked like back in those days.

								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
																		Today mailing lists are still pretty much the same as they were backin 1970. You send an email - everyone else on the list gets the email. Simple.
									<BR><BR>
										Meanwhile other forms of group communication systems have come around in the last few decades that have a lot of interesting new features. We've
										got Facebook Groups, Reddit, Google+ Communities, and discussions forums such as with phpBB or the newer Discourse.org. There are also many others
										more focused on specific aspects of discussion, such as Q&A (Quora, StackOverflow) or real-time chat (Slack). Most of these have likes, they've got
										upvoting, you can follow threads, block people, follow certain people, and more.

									<img class="alignleft3" align="left" alt="mailing lists" src="img/mailinglistsCHI/mailinglistsCHI.004.jpg" />
								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
								But as I'm sure you all can attest, mailing lists are still ubiquitous tools for discussion. So then why are people still using them?
								Is it just a matter of inertia? Do people not know any better? Is it just the old people that still prefer mailing lists?
								<BR><BR>
									Well what we found as the answers to those questions is <strong>No</strong>. It turns out when we asked people, they had a lot of reasons
									for still preferring mailing lists over newer tools.
								</div>

								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
									Well that then leads us to wonder, with all these new tools, have we learned anything in the last 40 years? And what we found was <strong>Yes</strong>.
									Mailing lists have a lot of problems too. And some of these problems have been addressed in newer discussion systems and social media with the addition
									of newer features.

								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
									So what does this tell us? Well for one, we can learn from mailing lists. We can look at mailing lists as these
									systems that have had a really strong staying power despite them not evolving in 40 years. And we can look at why
									people prefer mailing lists and think about how to improve newer group discussion tools.
									<BR> <BR>
										Something else we can do, which I really really want to emphasize, is that <strong>we can improve mailing lists</strong>.
										And I want to emphasize this becaomse mailing lists haven't gotten a lot of love from developers or from research in
										comparison with other newer systems. And yet improvements on mailing lists could have a huge impact given just how many
										people out there still use them.

									Here's an outline of the 3 main questions I'll be tackling in this talk.
									So the first of the questions we examine then is - why are mailing lists still around? Why are people still using them
									in the face of newer social media?<BR> <BR>
										Then we look at what problems people still have on current mailing list systems.<BR> <BR>
											And finally, we consider how the problems that are on mailing lists could be improved with new features, some of which are
											implemented in newer systems.

									We conducted in-depth interviews with 10 members each of two different mailing list communities. We chose two communities
									that were relatively large and well-established in terms of how long they had been around and how integrated they were in the
									community. <BR><BR>
										We analyzed the interview data using a generative approach and as the interviews went on, iteratively built up common themes
										we saw. We then built a survey to reach more members of the communities.
										<BR><BR>
											And finally, we sent the same survey to 28 other communities of varying size and functin, so including social groups, academic groups,
											cultural clubs, neighborhood lists, sports teams, and more.
											<BR> <BR>
												In total we interviewed 20 people and surveyed 415 people.

									The first, which we call LAB is a 1000-person technology research lab in a mid-sized university. This mailing list
									has existed for around 15 years and is comprised of mostly graduate students, who are automatically added to the list,
									some undergraduates, researchers, faculty, and administrators. They have discussions, Q&As event announcements, and other 
									community chatter.<BR> <BR>
										The list has public archives and also is open for anyone to join. so it also contains many outside parties and alumni

subreddits, and G+ communities.

After mailing lists, we found that Facebook Groups were used the most often out of all the tools. We found that 68% of people surveyed used mailing lists often or always
while the next most used system was Facebook Groups, which 26% of people used often or always.

	We asked interviewees to explain why they were not interested in moving to other systems and found 4 main themes.
	We focus now primarily on Facebook Groups as this was the most analogous system in people's minds. <BR><BR>
		And actually for both communities, there did exist a Facebook Group in addition to the mailing list already. And in both cases, the
		Facebook Groups had very low activity. So the comparison was quite concrete for many of our interviewees.

		The first reason that people stated was that email is still considered as a tool for work while Facebook is considered a place for
		play and also for procrastination from work.

Other interviewees felt a bit more conflicted and felt that the discussion on the mailing list was kind of something in between normal emails and 
social media, in that sometimes it was more like work (such as event announcements) and sometimes it was more like play (humorous banter). And people
disagreed about whether or not mailing list emails were distracting from other more work-related emails. We'll come back to this idea of something in between later.

		Many interviewees mentioned the images of people's faces and hyperlinks to their profiles as contributing to the public feeling of Facebook.
		And they used this as a reason for why they thought the community moving to Facebook Groups would result in a lot less participation as more people self-censor.

		However, a troubling thing that we did notice was that most interviewees had no idea that their mailing list archives were completely public. <BR><BR>
			Also when we asked people to guess how many subscribers were on the list, most people underestimated the number, sometimes by an order of magnitude.
			For instance, only 7% of people surveyed in LAB correctly guessed the size of the list. The median guess was 500-800 people while the true number is over 4000.

This interviewee invoked how non-deterministic algorithms that manipulate many feeds gave him less confidence that people would see his post. So when he wanted to get the 
word out about an event or ask for help, he chose to turn to the mailing list instead of to Facebook Groups.

	In fact 67% of the people we surveyed liked that they could create their own filters and move things to different folders. Several
	interviewees mentioned appreciating the different tabs that Gmail introduced to separate out different categories of emails. Others created their own
	filter to move different mailing lists to separate dedicated folders.
	Additionally almost all interviewees liked the ability to use subject lines to quickly skim over unseen content. 
<BR><BR>
	Many interviewees complained about how on Facebook Groups, you can either have notifications on or notifications off.  
	So when they're on and the group posts often, your phone is now buzzing all the time, so you get annoyed and turn them off. Now you no longer check
	or post to the group anymore because you're too preoccupied with your main news feed and don't have notifications to remind you about the group. And then
	over time the group activity dies.

								<BR><BR>
									A fear of spamming large audiences. Maybe because you think people will actually ready your email, you worry about being
									annoying or taking up too much of people's time.
								<BR><BR>
									Also misinterpretation was a big issue for DORM since many of the people know each other and see each other. People were worried
									about wading in on controversial topics for fear of saying the wrong thing and offending or hurting others.
									<BR><BR>
										Heated arguments was an issue as well. As they say, "Don't feed the troll." This was an issue in LAB, where people would get into

		Let me explain a bit what that means. In traditional "push" systems, senders actively push content to recipients. In these systems, such as with
		traditional email and text messaging, there's an expectation that recipients receive all messages and they receive them in real-time.
		<BR><BR>
			In pull systems, senders make content available and recipients pull it when they want to access it. So in most cases, social media, forums, and RSS are 
			examples of pull systems.

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
However, when we think about push versus pull in terms of <strong>practice</strong> as opposed to the technical system, we can see how
some email strategies are like traditional push systems while other mailing list access strategies maintain a practice more similar to pull systems.
<BR><BR>
	So a push experience would mean reading mailing list emails just like other emails and receiving them in the main inbox. And a pull
	experience would mean using a filter to automatically file emails into a separate folder or tab.
	<BR><BR>
	When we surveyed and interviewed people, we found that most people used one of these two strategies to manage their email.
	People using pull were more likely to miss emails and read emails when they felt like it. People using push were more likely to get annoyed
	about missing emails and also to read every email from the list.

								<div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-6">
To give a sense of the perspectives of push versus pull people, I have the following quotes from two different people.
From this you can begin to see how the strategy that you employ might alter your expectations of how other people also access their
mailing list email. And you can see how this tension could exacerbate the two other tensions mentioned including over disagreement over
type and quantity and also fear of spamming others.

			Well there's actually some good reasons to focus attenion on mailing lists. First off, you don't have to worry as much about a user interface -
			the main user interface that people will be using is their own preferred email client.
			<BR><BR>
				This also means less disruption to users because they can keep doing what they're already doing.
				<BR><BR>
					And finally, mailing lists aren't a monolith like social media systems so you don't have to worry about getting
					all your friends onto this new system. Thus it can be a lot easier to get different communities to try out a new list system.

					One thing to consider is how we noticed from the interviews many people describing the content on mailing lists as

						Another thing we might consider is changing up how everyone receives every post right now on mailing lists. But we need to be careful

				For instance, we still want to maintain the notion of guaranteed delivery since that was something mentioned as important to people
				But we also want to encourage people who are shy about posting to contribute more. So some things we could do here could be:
				<BR><BR>
					We could still give every person every email but make it easier for people to divert different content to different folders. 
					<BR><BR>
						We could break guaranteed delivery only in the cases where people are shy and possibly wouldn't have posted anyway. We could allow
						people to post to only a small subset of users and grow the recipients to more people if the readers upvote the post.
						<BR><BR>
							And we could introduce "friend-moderators" or people you select to vet your post before it gets posted more widely.
							<BR><BR>
								One thing we might want to keep in mind here is how we might deterministic filtering as opposed to non-deterministic filtering,
								such as a news-feed-like opaque algorithm, to allow users to still feel in control of what emails they get and don't get, which
								is something that interviewees said they liked about email.

						Some future work we are in the process of doing now is to look at more work-oriented mailing lists and see
